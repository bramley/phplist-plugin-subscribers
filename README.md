# Subscribers Plugin #

## Description ##

The plugin adds pages to the Subscribers menu:

* advanced search - search for subscribers and show subscriber attributes with confirmed and blacklisted status
* subscriber history - shows history events: all, since a start date or those containing specific text
* subscriptions - lists the number of subscriptions and unsubscriptions for each month with a chart showing the data graphically
* subscriber commands - apply a command to a file or group of subcriber email addresses

The plugin also provides a placeholder [LISTUNSUBSCRIBE] to remove a subscriber from the list to which the campaign was sent.
